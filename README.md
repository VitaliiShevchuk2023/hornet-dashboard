# 🐝 NABU Hornet Dashboard — Streamlit Prototype

**Project:** CorrelAid × NABU (Naturschutzbund Deutschland)

**Purpose:** Exploratory prototype for analyzing the spread of *Vespa crabro* (European hornet) and *Vespa velutina* (Asian hornet) using GBIF occurrence data.

## Overview

This dashboard is a **rapid prototype** built to explore and visualize hornet occurrence patterns across Central Europe. It covers six research questions relevant to NABU's conservation monitoring work, from species displacement and habitat preference to climate influence and protected area presence.

> ⚠️ This is a **Streamlit prototype**, not the final product. The production dashboard will be implemented in **Django + HTMX**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Multi-page Streamlit application with a shared data loading utility:

```
streamlit_app.py            # Main dashboard — overview metrics, timeline, map
utils/
  gbif_loader.py            # Shared data loading, caching, and cleaning logic
pages/
  1_Overview.py             # Q1 — Species displacement & overlap map
  2_Displacement.py         # Q2 — European hornet geographic distribution
  3_Distribution.py         # Q5 — Synanthropic behavior (urban vs. rural)
  4_Habitat.py              # Q3 — Habitat type analysis
  4_Urban_Rural.py          # (placeholder — not yet implemented)
  5_Protected_Areas.py      # Q4 — Presence in protected areas
  6_Climate.py              # Q6 — Climate & weather influence
download_gbif.py            # Standalone script: bulk-download GBIF data to CSV
data/                       # Local CSV cache (gitignored — large files)

## 🔬 Research Questions

| Page | Research Question | Key Visualizations |
|---|---|---|
| **Main** | Overview of both species | Timeline (line chart), scatter map |
| **Q1 — Overview** | Is the European hornet being displaced? | Overlap scatter map, bar chart by Bundesland |
| **Q2 — Displacement** | How widespread is the European hornet in Germany? | Latitude/longitude histograms, density heatmap |
| **Q3 — Habitat** | Which habitat types show highest hornet presence? | Keyword-classified bar + pie chart, monthly seasonality |
| **Q4 — Protected Areas** | Do Asian hornets occur more in Natura 2000 areas? | Protected area flag, grouped bar + pie chart |
| **Q5 — Distribution** | Is the Asian hornet synanthropic? | Regional bar chart, raw data table, debug mode |
| **Q6 — Climate** | How do weather conditions affect hornet spread? | Climate zones, seasonal line chart, January temperature chart |

### Sidebar Controls

All pages share consistent sidebar filters:

| Control | Options | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Country | `DE`, `FR`, `BE`, `NL`, `AT`, `CH` | `DE` |
| Max records per species | 100 – 1000 | 300 |
| Year range | 2000 – 2025 | 2010 – 2025 |

<a id="data-layer"></a>
## 📦 Data Layer (`utils/gbif_loader.py`)

- Loads occurrence records for both species via **pygbif** (GBIF REST API)
- For Germany (`DE`), prioritizes a **Google Drive CSV cache** pre-built by `download_gbif.py` — up to 20,000 records per year, covering 2000–2025
- Falls back to the **live GBIF API** for all other countries (sampled, ~10–12 records/year)
- All results cached with `@st.cache_data` (TTL: 1 h for API, 24 h for Drive)
- Cleans and normalizes: coordinates, `year`/`month` from `eventDate`, GADM administrative levels (`bundesland`, `landkreis`), species label and color
- Exposes `SPECIES`, `COLORS`, `load_both()`, and `load_observations()` to all pages

## 🧠 Design Decisions

**Offline-first for Germany**
`download_gbif.py` pre-downloads full GBIF datasets and stores them as CSVs on Google Drive. This avoids API rate limits during live demos and enables full dataset analysis rather than sampled subsets.

**Proxy-based habitat and protected area analysis**
Both habitat type (Q3) and protected area status (Q4) are inferred from the free-text `locality` field using keyword matching (`"wald"`, `"naturschutz"`, `"ffh"`, etc.). This is a pragmatic workaround — the production version should use spatial joins with Corine Land Cover and WDPA / Natura 2000 polygon layers.

**Citizen science bias warning**
Q5 explicitly surfaces the observer effect: urban areas are over-represented in GBIF data because more people submit sightings there, which can falsely suggest higher population density in cities.

**Real climate data via Open-Meteo**
Q6 fetches ERA5 reanalysis data for 6 representative German cities to use average January temperature as a proxy for winter severity — the primary climatic constraint on Asian hornet queen survival and range expansion.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

| Area | Limitation |
|---|---|
| Urban/rural analysis | `pages/4_Urban_Rural.py` is empty — not yet implemented |
| Habitat & protected areas | Classification uses locality text keywords, not actual spatial boundaries |
| Statistics | No formal testing yet (correlation coefficients, significance tests) |
| Germany focus | CSV cache only covers `DE`; other countries use a small live API sample |
| Production readiness | Prototype only — no authentication, persistent storage, or scheduled data updates |

**Production target:** Django + HTMX with PostgreSQL/PostGIS backend, Leaflet.js maps, and weekly automated GBIF sync via Celery.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A Google Drive file ID for each species CSV (optional — app falls back to live API without it)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/nabu-hornet-dashboard.git
cd nabu-hornet-dashboard

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration (optional)

To use the Google Drive CSV cache for Germany, create `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

```toml
EU_HORNET_GDRIVE_ID = "your_google_drive_file_id_here"
AS_HORNET_GDRIVE_ID = "your_google_drive_file_id_here"
```

To enable the debug panel on Q5:

```toml
DEBUG = true
```

### Pre-download GBIF data (optional)

Run once to build the full Germany CSV dataset locally before uploading to Drive:

```bash
python download_gbif.py
```

### Run the app

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501`.
